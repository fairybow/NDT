# Comprehensive Guidelines for Defining End of Turn (EOT)

## Definition and Core Principles

End of Turn (EOT) refers to the point at which a speaker completes their speaking contribution and the conversational floor becomes available for another participant. In conversation analysis, turn-taking is "the manner in which orderly conversation normally takes place", with EOT being a critical boundary point in this system.

## Primary EOT Indicators

1. **Syntactic Completion**:
   - Complete grammatical structures (sentences, clauses, phrases)
   - Structurally complete questions or statements

2. **Intonational Cues**:
   - Falling intonation (for statements)
   - Rising intonation (for questions)
   - Voice quality changes (e.g., creaky voice at utterance ends)

3. **Prosodic Features**:
   - Final syllable lengthening
   - Decreasing volume/intensity
   - Rhythm changes or speech rate slowing

4. **Pragmatic Completion**:
   - Completion of a communicative action (request, question, etc.)
   - End of a narrative unit or topic
   - Accomplished conversational goal

5. **Non-verbal Signals**:
   - Sustained eye contact with listener
   - Hand gestures that signal completion
   - Body orientation changes
   - Head movements (nods, tilts)

## Turn Transition Relevance Places (TRPs)

A Transition Relevance Place (TRP) occurs at "the end of a TCU [Turn Construction Unit]" and is "a point where the turn may end and a new speaker may begin." These are critical points where turn exchange commonly occurs.

## Types of Turn Endings

1. **Clean Ending**: Clear EOT with all indicators present, followed by next speaker's turn.

2. **Collaborative Completion**: When another speaker completes the current speaker's turn.

3. **Trailing Off**: Decreased volume, slower pace, and often incomplete syntax.

4. **Explicit Hand-off**: Direct selection of next speaker through question, name, or gesture.

5. **Interrupted Ending**: Current turn ends due to interruption by another speaker.

6. **Abandoned Turn**: Speaker stops without completing their intended message.

## Cultural and Contextual Factors

1. **Cultural Variation**:
   - While the general structure of avoiding overlapping talk is "universal," "turn-taking conventions vary by culture and community" in aspects like "how turns are distributed" and "how transitions are signaled."
   - Different pause lengths are acceptable in different cultures

2. **Conversational Context**:
   - Formal settings may have more structured turn-taking
   - Multi-party conversations have different dynamics than dyadic ones
   - Institutional settings (classrooms, interviews) follow specific patterns

## Technology-Mediated Communication

1. **Video Calls**:
   - Technical delays can affect normal turn-taking
   - Reduced visibility of non-verbal cues

2. **Audio-Only Communication**:
   - Greater reliance on vocal cues
   - More explicit verbal hand-offs

## EOT Detection Challenges

1. **False Completions**: Points that appear to be EOT but aren't.

2. **Backchanneling vs. Turn-Taking**: "Backchannelling" utterances like "Uh, huh" or "Oh!" may be "encouragement to continue the turn" or may be "signalling a wish to take a turn."

3. **Recording Cut-offs**: When analyzing recordings, distinguishing natural EOT from recording termination.

4. **Speaker Habits**: Individual variation in signaling EOT.

## Technical Turn-End Estimation

1. **Pause Detection**: Measuring silence duration at potential completion points.

2. **Prosodic Analysis**: Research shows "listeners take intonational phrasing into account when projecting the end of conversational turns."

3. **Lexico-syntactic Processing**: Analysis of grammatical structures and their completion.

4. **Multi-modal Integration**: Combining verbal and non-verbal cues.

These guidelines represent the current understanding in conversational analysis research regarding End of Turn detection and can serve as a comprehensive framework for analyzing and defining EOT in various contexts.
